       "{'comment': 'This dataset represents the synthetyc fuels production from coal in South Africa (ZA). These operations are supported by mining coal and converting it into synthetic fuels and chemicals through proprietary Fischer-Tropsch technology by Sasol, the biggest synfuels producer in ZA (and worldwide). Its productions accounts for 150 000 bbl/day of crude-equivalent. \\nHigh Temperature Fisher-Tropsch process makes use of an iron-based catalyst. However no information on catalyst supply or the amount used was available in the public reports.\\nGeography:  SECUNDA SYFUEL OPERATIONS are  bases in Secunda (South Africa); SSO receives coal from 5 mines in Mpumalanga province. SECUNDA CHEMICAL OPERATIONS operates production facilities in Secunda (SA). Attached figure show the Secunda complex (inclusive of the mining sites) and the operation based in Secunda and Sasolburg.\\nImage: https://db3.ecoinvent.org/images/a79dc0c2-0dda-47ec-94e0-6f076bc8cdb6\\nTechnology:  SECUNDA SYNFUEL OPERATIONS: Secunda Synfuels Operations operates the world’s only commercial coal-based synthetic fuels manufacturing facility of its kind, producing synthesis gas (syngas) through coal gasification and natural gas reforming. They make use of their proprietary technology to convert syngas into synthetic fuel components, pipeline gas and chemical feedstock for the downstream production of solvents, polymers, comonomers and other chemicals. Primary internal customers are Sasol Chemicals Operations, Sasol Exploration and Production International and other chemical companies. Carbon is produced for the recarburiser, aluminium, electrode and cathodic production markets. \\nSecunda Synfuels Operations receives coal from five mines in Mpumalanga (see figure attached). After being crushed, the coal is blended to obtain an even quality distribution. Electricity is generated by both steam and gas and used to gasify the coal at a temperature of 1300°C. This produces syngas from which two types of reactor - circulating fluidised bed and Sasol Advanced SynthoTM reactors – produce components for making synthetic fuels as well as a number of downstream chemicals. Gas water and tar oil streams emanating from the gasification process are refined to produce ammonia and various grades of coke respectively.\\nSECUNDA CHEMICAL OPERATIONS: The Secunda Chemicals Operations hub forms part of the Southern African Operations and is the consolidation of all the chemical operating facilities in Secunda, along with Site Services activities. The Secunda Chemicals hub produces a diverse range of products that include industrial explosives, fertilisers; polypropylene, ethylene and propylene; solvents (acetone, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), ethanol, n-Propanol, iso-propanol, SABUTOL-TM, PROPYLOL-TM, mixed C3 and C4 alcohols, mixed C5 and C6 alcohols, High Purity Ethanol, and Ethyl Acetate) as well as the co-monomers, 1-hexene, 1-pentene and 1-octene and detergent alcohol (SafolTM). \\nImage: https://db3.ecoinvent.org/images/a79dc0c2-0dda-47ec-94e0-6f076bc8cdb6',\n",
